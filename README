DFBTerm
=======

DFBTerm is a terminal emulator running on DirectFB and can use either libtsm or libzvt
as terminal emulation backend.

libzvt (Zed's virtual terminal emulation library) is included directly in the source code,
although it is possible to use the system's libzvt library.

libtsm (Terminal-emulator state machine library) has an internal static helper library
that is included in the source code.
